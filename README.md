# Hi, I'm Ivana

I’m a Computer Science and Engineering student at the Faculty of Computer Science and Engineering in Skopje, specializing in PIT (Applied Information Technologies).

I’m passionate about building practical software solutions and continuously improving my skills in full-stack and mobile development. I enjoy working on projects that combine clean architecture, real-world APIs, and thoughtful user experience.

## Current Project

### LitLog

I’m currently developing **LitLog**, a full-stack book tracking application.

LitLog integrates with an external books API and implements:

- Role-based authorization
- RESTful backend architecture
- Search functionality with admin-managed suggestions
- Reading lists
- Sorting and filtering
- Private reviews and notes per user
- Secure authentication and protected routes

This project allows me to deepen my understanding of:
- Backend development and API integration  
- Database design and relational modeling  
- Authentication & authorization  
- Full-stack application structure

## Outside of Tech

When I’m not coding, I enjoy working out, hiking, exploring nature, and staying active. I believe discipline in sports translates directly into discipline in engineering — consistency builds results.

I’m always open to learning, collaboration, and building meaningful software.
